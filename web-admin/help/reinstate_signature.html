<h1>How to reinstate a removed signature</h1>

<p>If a signature has been removed in error, or if a signer has requested that their signature be removed and then changed their mind, then the signature will need to be reinstated by an administrator. &nbsp;You should not advise the signer to &ldquo;just sign the petition again&rdquo; &mdash; the system prevents multiple signatures which use the same email address, and a &ldquo;removed&rdquo; signature is still in the system, just not visible to the public.</p>

<p>A signature can only be reinstated from the admin page for the relevant petition. &nbsp;All removed signatures are displayed underneath the current signatures. By the name of each removed signature there is a checkbox next to the word &lsquo;Reinstate&rsquo;. For any signature that you wish to reinstate, tick the checkbox and then click &lsquo;Reinstate all ticked&rsquo;:</p>

<p>This will put the signature back onto the petition.</p>
