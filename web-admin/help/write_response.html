<h1>To write a response to a petition</h1>

<p>The ability for a council to write and send a response easily to all people who have signed a petition is one of the benefits of online petitions over paper petitions. You can write a response to a live petition, or to one that has finished.</p>

<p>The procedure for writing a response is simple &ndash; but it is important that the response is treated as a piece of official council correspondence, since it will be emailed out to all signatories, and listed on the petition website.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;write response&rsquo; form is not for sending a message to the petition creator, or to individual signatories: whatever you write is emailed to everyone and posted on the public website. &nbsp;If you wish to contact individuals then find their email address or telephone number in the admin interface and contact them directly.</p>

<p>To send a response to all people who have signed a petition (and leave a copy of this response on the website) click the &lsquo;Write response&rsquo; button: you can find this button on the admin page for the petition in question:</p>

<p>Or you can find it under &lsquo;Actions&rsquo; in the list of Live petitions in the admin interface (Finished petitions if the petition has finished):</p>

<p>If a petition has already had one response sent to it then the &lsquo;Actions&rsquo; column will no longer display any buttons, but you can still send another response. Click the Admin link for that petition, and you will find a &lsquo;Write response&rsquo; button on the admin page.</p>

<p>Clicking either &lsquo;Write response&rsquo; button will take you through to a page where you can compose your response. &nbsp;It is obligatory to have a subject line and text in the response box. &nbsp;Further information is optional. &nbsp;Note that the response must be written in plain text &ndash; formatting, such as italics or bold, will not transfer.</p>

<p>Once you have written the response, click the &lsquo;Preview&rsquo; button:</p>

<p>The preview shows you the response laid out exactly as it will be sent to signers and listed on the website. A footer, containing the petition URL and opt-out information, is automatically appended to the message, as shown in the preview:</p>

<p>If you notice any errors in the preview, then simply edit the text in the boxes underneath the preview. You can preview any changes by clicking the &lsquo;Preview&rsquo; button again.</p>

<p>Once you are happy with the text of your response, click the &lsquo;Send&rsquo; button:</p>

<img class="pet-screenshot" src="help/images/pet10image04.jpg">

<p>This will send the response out to the petition creator and all other signers, and post a copy of the response to the petition page on the public website.</p>

<p>If the response was sent out before the petition closed, then it will be listed at the top of the petition&rsquo;s page on the public site, so that any new signers can read it before they choose to sign the petition:</p>

<p>A response sent after a petition has closed is also listed on the website with the date that it was sent out.</p>

<p>You can send out as many responses as you wish.</p>
