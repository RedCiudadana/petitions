<h1>The admin history of a petition</h1>

<p>The petitions system automatically makes notes to record events in the life of a petition, such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Administrator approves a petition</li>
  <li>Administrator rejects a petition, with the reasons</li>
  <li>Signatures confirmed or removed</li>
  <li>Responses that the council has sent</li>
  <li>And everything else that happens to it!</li>
</ol>
<p>You can view this record on the admin page for each petition under &lsquo;Administrator events and notes&rsquo;, and you can manually add notes of your own.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s more than one person working on petitions admin, this section is useful to see what your colleagues have already done, and you can communicate with them by leaving messages. &nbsp;In the example below, one council officer is explaining to other staff members why a petition cannot yet be approved/rejected.</p>

<p>To leave a note, simply write the note in the box under &lsquo;Administrator events and notes&rsquo; and click &lsquo;Add&rsquo;:</p>

<p>The new note is then listed along with the other notes and events in this section:</p>
<img class="pet-screenshot" src="help/images/pet12image01.jpg">

<p>It is not possible to delete/edit a note, but a further note can be left if need be, correcting the previous one.</p>

<p>(Note that these screenshots have been taken from the demo site, which is why the user is listed as &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; - in a live council site the name of the user would be shown.)</p>
