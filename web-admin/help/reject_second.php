<h1>To reject a petition for the second time</h1>

<p>If you wish to reject a resubmitted petition because it is still inappropriate, the rejection process is the same as for the first rejection.</p>

<p>Click the &lsquo;Reject&rsquo; button on the admin interface page for that petition (or the &lsquo;Reject&rsquo; button under &lsquo;Actions&rsquo; on the list of Draft petitions).</p>

<p>Fill out the three stages to the rejection process: the category/ies for rejection, the reason/s for rejection, and hide any inappropriate parts of the petition. Finally, click the &lsquo;Reject petition&rsquo; button:</p>

<p>This will send the petition creator an email automatically, letting them know that the petition has been rejected again, and giving them the categories and reasons you have just specified. </p>

<p>The petition can now be found under the &lsquo;Rejected&rsquo; petitions in the admin interface, and will immediately be displayed on the public website under rejected petitions, along with the category/ies and reason/s for rejection, and minus any hidden information.</p>

<p>Once a petition has been rejected twice the creator cannot revise and resubmit it (although they can start a brand new petition with the same information if they wish).</p>
