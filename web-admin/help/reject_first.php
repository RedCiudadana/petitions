<h1>To reject a petition for the first time</h1>

<p>When a petition creator clicks the confirmation link in their confirmation email, the petition moves into Draft status in the admin interface and an email is sent to the relevant administrator alerting them to the fact that there is a Draft petition waiting for approval/rejection.</p>

<p>In order to reject a petition, first ensure that you are in the Draft section of the admin interface; this is where the unapproved petitions are:</p>

<p>From this screen you can reject a petition immediately if it is so obviously inappropriate that you don&rsquo;t need to see any further details. Simply click the &lsquo;Reject&rsquo; button under &lsquo;Actions&rsquo; (in this case it is clear from the Petition title and Creator name shown in the Draft list of petitions that this petition is inappropriate):</p>

<p>If you wish to see further information about the petition before deciding whether or not to reject it, click on the &lsquo;admin&rsquo; link, located under the petition reference (short name) for that petition:</p>

<img class="pet-screenshot" src="help/images/pet04image02.jpg">

<p>This will take you to the admin page for that petition, which contains all the details supplied by the petition creator about the petition. There is also a &lsquo;Reject&rsquo; button on this screen:</p>

<p>Clicking the &lsquo;Reject&rsquo; button (either on the admin page for that petition, or where the petition appears in the list of Draft petitions) will take you through to another page to give more information about why the petition is being rejected.</p>

<p>There are three parts to the rejection process: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the category/categories for rejection by ticking one or more boxes; the categories will be emailed to the petition creator.</li>
  <li>Give a full explanation of the reason.</li>
  <li>Select which parts of the petition should not be shown on the public website (you may need to hide certain parts of the petition text for legal reasons).</li>
  </ol>
  
 <p>
     In more details, these steps are:
</p>
<p>1. Select the category/categories for rejection by ticking one or more boxes. </p>

<p>2. Give the reason(s) for rejection. These will be emailed to the petition creator, to give them some guidance if they decide to resubmit their petition, so be as helpful as possible about what was wrong with the petition: you will probably get a better petition second time around.</p>

<p>You can type text into the &lsquo;Reason for rejection&rsquo; box; additionally, there are some pre-written common reasons shown to the right of the box &ndash; simply click on any of these to add them automatically:</p>

<p>3. Select the parts of the petition that you do not want to have listed in the &lsquo;Rejected petitions&rsquo; part of the public website. This might be because they are libellous, or offensive, or contain personal information or commercial adverts.</p>

<p>Tick the box beside any piece of information which you wish to hide:</p>

<p>Finally, click the &lsquo;Reject petition&rsquo; button.</p>

<p>This will send the petition creator an email automatically, letting them know that the petition has been rejected, giving them the categories and reasons you have just specified, and a link that they can use if they wish to revise and resubmit their petition.</p>

<p>The petition can now be found under the &lsquo;Rejected&rsquo; petitions in the admin interface. However, it will not appear on the public website under rejected petitions immediately. &nbsp;The petition creator is given time (the exact amount is specified in your council&rsquo;s petitions scheme) to revise and resubmit their petition for approval. &nbsp;The petition will only be listed under rejected petitions if they have not done so after this time has passed.</p>
