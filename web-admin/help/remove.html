<h1>To remove a petition</h1>

<p>Petitions should only be removed in extreme circumstances, usually at the request of the petition creator. Removing a petition removes all trace of it from the public website. &nbsp;In most instances, the best procedure for council transparency is to reject the petition and hide information from public view as necessary. </p>

<p>To remove a petition click the &lsquo;Remove petition&rsquo; button on the petition&rsquo;s admin page:</p>

<p>You can also find a &lsquo;Remove&rsquo; button under &lsquo;Actions&rsquo; on the Draft/Live/Finished/Rejected list (whichever is relevant for the petition in question), unless the petition has had a response sent to it; in that case you can find it only on the petition&rsquo;s admin page.</p>



<p>Clicking either button will take you through to the same page, where you will be asked to give a reason why the petition is being removed. Once you have noted the reason, click the &lsquo;Remove petition&rsquo; button:</p>

<p>The petition will be removed completely from the public website, but will still be available in the admin interface. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The only way of finding a removed petition in the admin interface is to search for it, using either the petition&rsquo;s short name or the name/email address of the petition creator. &nbsp;It will no longer be listed under any of the statuses, including Finished and Rejected. </p>

<p>If you remove a petition by accident you should search for it, click the &lsquo;Confirm petition, move to draft&rsquo; button, and then either approve or reject it as appropriate:</p>
